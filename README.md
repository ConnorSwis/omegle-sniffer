# omegle-sniffer

An IP locator for Omegle.

FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!

I wanted a project to filter internet traffic and use an API.

## Installation
1. Install tshark with [wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html)
2. Clone the repository
3. Install the required packages
4. Run sniff.py

## Usage
Press `shift + a` to locate the IP.

## Caveats
It may not work for some people. It could be that the filter is blocking their IP prefix. Also, other traffic may interfere with the results, so if the Org is Google LLC or Valve Corp., make sure to block that IP prefix.
